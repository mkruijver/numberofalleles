Description: The number of distinct alleles observed in a DNA mixture is informative of the number of contributors to the mixture. The package provides methods for computing the probability distribution of the number of distinct alleles in a mixture for a given set of allele frequencies. The mixture contributors may be related according to a provided pedigree.
